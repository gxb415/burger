# burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the devoured list on the page.
This app stores every burger in the database, whether or not it has been devoured.
